\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
The ratio of production cross-sections of \psitwos to \jpsi in $p$Pb and Pb$p$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16\tev$ are reported with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $13.6\pm0.3$nb$^{-1}$ for $p$Pb and $20.8\pm0.5$nb$^{-1}$ for Pb$p$ collected by the \lhcb detector in 2016. The (normalized) ratios of prompt and non-prompt \psitwos-to-\jpsi production, as functions of different multiplicity variables, are measured in region of $0\gev<\pt<14\gev$ and $1.5<y^*<4.5$ for $p$Pb and $-5.5<y^*<-2.5$ for Pb$p$.
 In $p$Pb collisions, we see an obvious decreasing trend for ratio of prompt production as a function of $N^{\rm PV}_{\rm tracks}$ and $N^{\rm PV}_{\rm fwd}$ in $p$Pb and a slower decrease as a function of $N^{\rm PV}_{\rm bwd}$. In Pb$p$ collisions, even though the ratios have an overall lower value compared to $p$Pb with same multiplicity scheme, the prompt and non-prompt \psitwos-to-\jpsi ratio does not show an obvious decrease as in $p$Pb. The overall ratios in $p$Pb and Pb$p$ show good agreements with other measurements in different collision systems at different energies. A forward-backward asymmetry is observed, where in $p$-going direction the result is compatible to that in $pp$ collisions and in Pb-going direction the \psitwos is suppressed more than in $pp$ collisions compared to \jpsi, which further indicates that the relative suppression of \psitwos to \jpsi have shown a different pattern to that in traditional small systems, in Pb-going direction (backward) where there is a larger mean multiplicity. The measurement comes to an agreement with other measurements.
