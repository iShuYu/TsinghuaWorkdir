\section{Other Systematic uncertainties}
\label{Systematic uncertainty}
Systematic uncertainties from different sources are studied and presented as follows.

The uncertainties due to limit size of data and simulated samples are considered, which manifests as the uncertainties in PID table, data-over-simulation single tracking efficiency ratio table, and correction of \pt and $y^*$ distributions between simulated sample and s-weighted data containing only signal obtained by $sPlot$ method~\cite{Pivk:2004ty}. Imperfection on simulating the acceptance is studied by performing a re-weight of \pt and $y^*$ distributions on simulated samples to match the distributions of s-Weighted samples, and hence, is also influenced by the limit sample size. The uncertainties listed above are propagated to the results using a large number of pseudoexperiments.

The uncertainties due to fit model is studied by replacing the single Crystal Ball function for \psitwos by a double Crystal Ball function with common means, and the relation between two widths, between the widths and positions of tails are determined through simulation. Then a new two-dimensional fit is performed. Difference between the results and original results are compared to the statistical uncertainties, which are 3 to 8 times smaller and hence, negligible.

The trigger efficiency is estimated from simulation and is cross-checked by a data-driven method using a fully reconstructed sample. The trigger efficiency in data is determined using a subset of events that would have triggered if the \jpsi and \psitwos signal were excluded~\cite{LHCb-DP-2012-004}. The relative difference between data and simulation is taken as a systematic uncertainty.

The uncertainty of $\BR(\jpsi\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-)=(5.961\pm0.033)\%$ and  $\BR(\psitwos\rightarrow e^+e^-)=(7.93\pm0.17)\times10^{-3}$ are quoted from 2022 PDG review, and they are canceled when \psitwos-to-\jpsi production ratio is normalized to that $pp$ collisions. The uncertainty of the luminosity is canceled out when calculating the ratio. 

The uncertainties are summarized in table~\ref{AllSysErr}.
