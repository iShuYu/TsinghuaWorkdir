\section{Fitting plots in each kinematic bin}
\label{sec:FitPlots}
\subsection*{1 Separated by PVNTRACKS}
For each kinematic bin of \jpsi and \psitwos candidates, the two-dimensional fit to the invariant mass and the lifetime are shown below.
The left is the invariant mass and the right is pseudo-proper decay time fit results. The first row in each figure set is  that of \jpsi and the second row is that of \psitwos.
