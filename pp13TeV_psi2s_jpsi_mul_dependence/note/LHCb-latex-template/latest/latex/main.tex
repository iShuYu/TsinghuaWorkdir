%The author list for journal publications is generated from the
%Membership Database shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been
%given.  It is available at \url{https://lbfence.cern.ch/membership/authorship}
%and will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number
%has been assigned.  
%The author list should be included in the draft used for 
%first and second circulation, to allow new members of the collaboration to verify
%that they have been included correctly. Occasionally a misspelled
%name is corrected, or associated institutions become full members.
%Therefore an updated author list will be sent to you after the final
%EB review of the paper.  In case line numbering doesn't work well
%after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after
%the last author to a separate line.
%The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb
%collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
%author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
%The authorship for Figure Reports should be ``The LHCb
%collaboration'', with no contact author and without the full list 
%of collaboration names.
